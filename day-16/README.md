# Some notes

It seems the problem is about a graph.
I'm very bad to resolve graph problem.

I think day and night about this problem but the solution doesn't come... And it seems that I am not the only one ==> .

So I give up on this puzzle and I'll come back to it later so as not to lose the thread of the advent calendar.

I have the impression to have fallen on a "Mon-Cheri" for day 16.
