# Some notes

For this one, I started to develop something working but with bad practices and then try to refactor it step by step to see if it's possible to improve the code to make it readable and maintainable.

My first try to resolve the second puzzle was bugged because I didn't find the good answer. So it shows how it can be hard to develop without any test to be sure some code piece is working well.

It's possible to follow every development steps in detail with the commits.
